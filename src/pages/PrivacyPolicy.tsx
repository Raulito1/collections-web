      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        This Privacy Policy explains how the Collections web application ("Service") collects, uses,
        and protects personal information. By using the Service you consent to the practices described
        in this policy.
      </p>

        The Service may collect account details, authentication data, and usage information necessary

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">

      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        Reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are employed to protect personal

        Personal information is retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in

        Users may request access to, correction of, or deletion of their personal information subject
